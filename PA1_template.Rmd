## Loading and preprocessing the data
### The variables included in this dataset are:

- steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are 
coded as 𝙽𝙰)
- date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format
- interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken

```{r Load data base}
sampleData <- read.csv("activity.csv", header = TRUE)
str(sampleData)
head(sampleData)
```
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r, include=FALSE}
require(dplyr); require(ggplot2)
```
Process data
```{r}
df1 <- sampleData %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarize(sum(steps)) %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(date, format = "%Y-%m-%d"))

names(df1) <- c("Date", "Total_Steps")
```
Plot data frame
```{r}
ggplot(data.frame(df1), aes(x=Total_Steps)) + 
  labs(title = "Total steps per day", y ="Frecuency")+
  geom_histogram(fill="lightblue") +
  stat_bin(bins=7)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}
mean(df1$Total_Steps)
median(df1$Total_Steps)
```

```{r}
df2 <- sampleData %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  group_by(interval) %>%
  summarize(mean(steps))

names(df2) <- c("Interval", "Mean_Steps")
```
Plot Total steps per each 5 min
```{r}
ggplot(df2, aes(x=Interval, y=Mean_Steps)) + 
  labs(title = "Total steps per each 5 min", y ="Frecuency", x ="Cumulative minutes")+
  geom_line()
```

Print the interval with max value 

```{r}
df2 %>% 
  filter(Mean_Steps == max(Mean_Steps)) 
```

## Imputing missing values
Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)

```{r}
nrow(filter(sampleData, is.na(steps)))
```

Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.

```{r}
func_comp <- function(steps, interval) {
    filled <- NA
    if (!is.na(steps))
        filled <- as.numeric(steps)
    else
        filled <- (df2[df2$Interval==interval, "Mean_Steps"])
    return(filled)
}
data2 <- sampleData
data2$steps <- mapply(func_comp, data2$steps, data2$interval)
```
Process data2
```{r}
df3 <- data2 %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarize(sum(as.numeric(steps))) %>% 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date, format = "%Y-%m-%d"))
  
names(df3) <- c("Date", "Total_Steps")
```
Plot data frame
```{r}
ggplot(data.frame(df3), aes(x=Total_Steps)) + 
  labs(title = "Total steps per day", y ="Frecuency")+
  geom_histogram(fill="lightblue") +
  stat_bin(bins=7)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}
mean(df3$Total_Steps)
median(df3$Total_Steps)
```

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

```{r}
days <- as.POSIXlt(sampleData$date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
WeekDays <- days$wday
table(WeekDays)
WeekDays[WeekDays == 0 | WeekDays == 6] = "weekend"
table(WeekDays)
WeekDays[WeekDays  != "weekend"] = "week"
table(WeekDays)
WeekDaysFactor <- factor(WeekDays, levels = c("weekend", "week"))
sampleData$WD <- WeekDaysFactor

df4 <- sampleData %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  group_by(interval, WD) %>%
  summarize(mean(steps))

names(df4) <- c("interval", "WD", "Mean_Steps")

```
I think this kind of graphics is more interesting and more easy
for analysis
```{r}
ggplot(df4, aes(x=interval, y=Mean_Steps, color =as.factor(WD))) + 
  labs(title = "Total steps per each 5 min", y ="Frecuency", x ="cumulative minutes")+
  geom_line()
```
